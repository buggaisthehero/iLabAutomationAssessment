WebGUI assignment

This application simply tests the Job Application Error functionality of Way2Automate's website (https://www.ilabquality.com/) when there are no uploaded documents.
I created this project using eclipse version: 2018-12 (4.10.0). There are no test/build tools used in the project e.g. Maven, JUnit etc.
I have opted to do a plain Java program to show case the coding and execution behind.

Below you there are a few things to note when running this application:

Tools used:
	selenium-server-standalone-3.11.0 
	Java 1.8.0_201
	Poi-3.9 (apache)
	Log4j-1.2.17
	joda-time-2.10.1
        Github
        Microsoft Excel (.docx)

Operating System
	Wndows 10
	
Browsers Installed on machine 
	Chrome  Version 72.0.3626.119 (64 bit)
        Internet ExplorerVersion 11 (64 bit)
	
	
Components of the application
	All dependencies (libraries/drivers) are in the "dependencies" folder
	An input file is located in the "Inputfile" folder where the UsersInputFile.xls is located. +
        This input file contains data in the form of a key/value pair e.g. Name=John, Surname=Mugabe etc.
	Some of the configuration and data mapping is placed in the src\config.properties file.
	Errors and Info logs are recorded in the log.txt at src\log4j.properties
	
Note:
	If you want to run/execute on one browser simply modify the BrowserTypes property in the config.properties file.
	"Chrome" will run only on the Chrome browser and "Chrome:Edge" will run on both Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers.

		
	To  run the project you can click execute.jar which is located in ..\QA Automation Assessment\AbsaAutomationAssessment\execute.jar.
